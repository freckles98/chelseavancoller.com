  content: "Hi there! I’m a software developer with over three years of experience, including one year in a team lead role. My background is rooted in backend and full-stack development, but I’m especially drawn to work that has a clear, positive impact. I’m currently on a gap year, which has given me space to reflect on the kind of work I want to return to: thoughtful, people-centred, and purpose-driven."
