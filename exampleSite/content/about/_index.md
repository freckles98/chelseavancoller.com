Hi there,

I am a software developer living in the mother city of Cape Town. I recently graduated (2021) from the University of Cape Town with a Bachelor of Business Science specialising in Computer Science. I am greatly interested in both fields, but
am currently working in a purely technical capacity.

I work for an excellent company called Electrum Payments that is located in Woodstock. They focus on facilitating payments between banks and retailers in South Africa.

My programming experience is mostly geared towards backend development specialising in Java, but I also have experience with Python, mySQL, HTML and CSS. I also have worked with technologies such as docker, n8n, multiple AWS products, etc.
I am always eager to learn and try new things.

In my personal life, I aspire to live a balanced healthy life. I am passionate about trail running or anything related to being on a mountain. On the weekend, I can be found at a play, on the mountain or with family and friends.
