#### Project Requirements

In October 2020, Lynn and I entered the Intervarsity Womxn in Technology Hackathon. The problem statement was to develop a solution that uses technology to tackle an issue that society is facing as a result of the covid-19 epidemic.


#### Project Details

We created an app that puts a social spin on reaching your daily step count. Our app was specifically targeted at schools who are unable to do sport at the moment due to the COVID-19 regulations. It encourages students to reach a class goal of steps and have students compete against other classes to achieve the most number of steps. This focuses on sport and education and gives the students a fun way to exercise together.
