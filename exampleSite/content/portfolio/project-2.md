#### Project Requirements

To use Ripe Atlas to study the geo-topology and performance within at least 20 universities in Africa.


#### Project Details

The African continent is fairly underdeveloped within the networking world due to economic disadvantage, expensive bandwidth and poor infrastructure. This study looks studies the ping and traceroutes deployed from Ripe Atlas to determine delays, AS-hops and country-level hops. The paper discovers that the African continent is poorly interconnected between countries, which results in delays and expensive overseas routing. African countries are well intraconnected and have achieved satisfactory delay times on routing packets within the country. There needs to be significant progress within Africa before these inter country latencies will be improved.
