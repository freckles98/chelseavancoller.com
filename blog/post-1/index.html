Written by Chelsea Van Coller based off the article by Jono Hart</p><p>This is the second year in which we embark on dissecting and gaining a better understanding of the developer community at UCT. This allows us to draw more comparisons and gain more understanding of how the community has changed over the past two years. In order to carry out our analysis, we sent out a survey to the predominant developer communities (GDSC, WICS and DevSoc) and received 140 responses from students.
Demographics
The majority of students are in second and third year, which is a positive shift, as last year’s demographic showed a decline in third years. There was also an increase in the number of fourth year and honours students from 17.8% to 31.9% combined. This means more students are privy to the excellent opportunities the developer communities offer especially in offering career development However, it is unfortunate to note the large decline in first years (from 26.9% to 11.6%). This could be attributed to lack of reach to first years, or disengagement as they adjust to online learning. This should be focused on in the upcoming years to foster programs that target the engagement of younger developers.</p><p>The community remains largely male-dominated with two-thirds of the community consisting of males. The gender gap within the STEM fields is a consistent problem, where the appeared gender stereotypes discourage students from pursuing these paths. At UCT we are fortunate enough to have the Womxn in Computer Science society that strives to encourage women to pursue a career in tech and encourage those who have chosen it as their career path. Hopefully in the years to come, the imagery behind these fields will change to encourage more diversity.</p><p>Most students engage with Instagram and LinkedIn as their predominant forms of social media. Twitter, Facebook, GitHub and Discord. Discord and Slack have seen the most growth over the last year, especially since there has been a push from the developer communities to use these platforms. Slack was especially encouraged through various hackathons as many people use it within the development world. However, it was found that Discord was the more widely known, popular choice.</p><p>Programming experience
The most popular programming languages are Python and Java, with 90% of students having been taught the languages in their first year. Languages such as SQL, R, C#, C++ and C are taught within UCT courses, thus there are a large number of students that are familiar with the languages. There has also been a large rise in the number of students that use web-based languages (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). Last year’s survey indicated that less than 3% of students were familiar with these languages. This is very encouraging as it indicates a growing interest in front-end development and shows that students are pursuing knowledge outside of their studies. (maybe write a little conclusion bout the importance of learning launguages outside the curriculum)Definitely do this will be informative to the developer reads</p><p>Java and C++ are by far the most challenging languages learnt. It could be argued that C++ is the most difficult since 98% of the students that have learnt C++ claimed it was. 53% of students found Java challenging, this could be attributed to the fact that it is the second language taught in university introducing object orientated programming, which can be difficult to grasp in the beginning. It is encouraging to note that the university is introducing students to computer science using Python as it appears to be a more palatable language by comparison.</p><p>Although most UCT development is done in Java, Python appears to be the preferred language and Java follows closely behind. A similar reflection was seen in the 2021 South African State of the Developer Nation by OfferZen, where Python was the most desirable language to learn. However, JavaScript is the most widely used language and Java and Python are about equal. JavaScript and HTML also have been largely selected by students, thus displaying keen interest for web development. This is a positive as JavaScript is the most widely used language.</p><p>Job Confidence
92% of students indicate that additional learning beyond what is taught within a degree is required in order to get a job. This is a somewhat concerning statistic from a university standpoint. Understandably universities wish to foster an environment that promotes further academic studies. However, it is a fact that most students will enter the job market, as there is limited space for postgraduate studies. Students should be sufficiently educated to perform a graduate level job. However, UCT should perhaps factor more job-related skills into their computer science degrees. As the developer market shifts and grows rapidly, the importance of a degree in computing is often speculated as unnecessary. - I like this</p><p>Around 40% of students have done internships or vac work, which is encouraging to see as it is an excellent way to gain perspective of the working world and improve your skills. This is a two percent increase from last year, which is encouraging to note. However, 60% of students were not able to or did not attempt to gain work experience, which may be a result of the pandemic. Many companies are unable to offer internship opportunities or offer more limited positions, as they cannot cater for many students. Multiple online internship programs have been noted throughout the year, which is reassuring that companies are able to cater for students throughout the pandemic. -Is this last point necessary ?</p><p>It is important to note how aware students are to the opportunities afforded to them and whether the problem lies within the lack of information. 41.6% of students are fairly aware of the opportunities in tech, which is a large increase from the 25% seen last year. The bulk of the community still remains in the middle, although the distribution is now skewed in favor of greater awareness. This indicates there has been improved engagement from employers and societies on the different opportunities in tech. They should work to improve this trend as every student should have access to all the opportunities available to them.</p><p>Many students have had wonderful internship experiences and we would like to note some companies that students commend as their favourite internship experiences. These include: Electrum payments, F-Secure, Amazon Web Services, SOLIDitech and OptiSolutions.We commend these companies for their continued involvement in fostering student growth and development.
Society Engagement
This year DevSoc was the most popular society with 76% of survey respondents having attended a DevSoc event. This could be attributed to the large number of events hosted this year, as well as events such at #BreakTheRules that bring in a large number of students. GDSC engagement was around 44%, which is a slight decrease from last year. This could be owed to the society still needing to register as an official UCT society, which hinders their access to the UCT students. WICS saw a slight increase to 31%, which is an impressive number considering that they are targeting a smaller audience and 33% of respondents identify as female.</p><p>A cultural aspect of being part of a developer society is hosting hackathons. Hackathons are hosted all over the world and provide developers with an excellent opportunity to join together to solve problems and learn. The UCT Developer Community places importance on hosting hackathons and at least one is held each year by each society. WICS and DevSoc joined forces this year to offer a Hackathon 101 series, in an attempt to introduce students to hackathons. It included how a hackathon works, ideation around the idea, web development and app development. It is gratifying to note that 47% of developers have participated in a hackathon which is a large increase from the 37% from last year. There is still a number of students (13%) that are unsure as to the concept. This could be due to lack of engagement with the societies.</p><p>It is noted that participating in a hackathon is a challenging task that usually spans a long period of time (24-48 hours). It may be challenging for students to carve out the necessary time, especially when faced with academic pressure. However, it is strongly encouraged that students attempt to partake in at least one hackathon within their university career. Generally, food is provided, prizes are up for grabs, much learning to be achieved and excellent developer connections to make.</p><p>Interests and Desires
We want to have a good understanding of the developer community in order to provide more effective content for our developers. A large aspect of the societies are teaching new technologies and this year the top interests are Web, Cybersecurity and Machine Learning. This mirrors the results seen last year; thus, societies need to look at how they can better accommodate these interests. Android and iOS both saw a significant decrease suggesting that students are looking at more web based solutions as an alternative.</p><p>Having technical skills is important in the working world; however, soft skills also play a significant role in making one a talented developer. Some of the soft skills students are interested in attaining are those of project management, interview skills and design thinking. UCT Developer Society hosted an interview skills workshop this year and it showed how much anxiety there is around interviews. Dev Societies need to look at helping students cross this barrier as it is important for acquiring the job they may desire.</p><p>This year more than half the community would like to see more hackathons and coding competitions, entry-level technical workshops and career guidance workshops. As there has been a revived interest in hackathons within the community, the societies should focus on this and delve deeper into motivated students to participate. The technical workshops should elaborate on the previous technical skills paragraph. Career guidance can be worked on with different companies that the students would like to work at and with assistance from the Careers Service.</p><p>We also asked the community which companies they would like to work for in the future. Many people mentioned the Big Five which are Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook) and Mircrosoft. Other South African companies were also mentioned such as Allan Gray, Takealot, Discovery and many more. The communities should use these references to potentially get speakers from these companies, so students can learn more about them.
Conclusions and recommendations
After evaluating results from 2020 and 2021, we can deduce that there has been significant growth within the developer community at UCT, which is delightful to note. Many of the interests and desires of the students have remained the same, indicating a clear path of focus for the future committees. The recommended considerations are:
Using the most popular platforms to engage with students such as Instagram and LinkedIn. Start to promote common tools used in the developer space such as GitHub and Discord.
Place more emphasis on advertising the societies to first years and targeting events towards them. As the pandemic passes, this may become easier to promote at in person events such as orientation week.
Communities should focus on workshops around Python, as developers have expressed keen interest in this. They should also look at introducing Javascript, as it is the most popular language in the working world.
Technical workshops should be hosted around web development, machine learning and cybersecurity. More non-technical workshops should focus on project management, interview skills and design thinking.
In general, the developer community would like more coding competitions,entry-level workshops and career guidance.
Communities could also look at training people in technologies and skills that are required for students’ dream jobs. For example, better understanding specific interview processes and educating the students or bringing in speakers from those companies.</p></div></div></div></div></section><footer class="bg-dark footer-section"><div class=section><div class=container><div class=row><div class=col-md-4><h5 class=text-light>Email</h5><p class="text-white paragraph-lg font-secondary"><a href=mailto:chelsvancoller@gmail.com>chelsvancoller@gmail.com</a></p></div><div class=col-md-4><h5 class=text-light>Phone</h5><p class="text-white paragraph-lg font-secondary"><a href=tel:101010100001111100110101010100>101010100001111100110101010100</a></p></div><div class=col-md-4><h5 class=text-light>Address</h5><p class="text-white paragraph-lg font-secondary">Cape Town, South Africa</p></div></div></div></div><div class="footer-bottom border-top text-center border-dark py-5"><p class="mb-0 text-light"></p></div></footer><script src=/plugins/jQuery/jquery.min.js></script>
