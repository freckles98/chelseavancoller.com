As the pandemic hit the masses, there was an increase in demand for access to the internet and telecommunications companies had to meet these demands. This essay will focus on the South African company, Rain, which is based on mobile data sales and delivers fast and affordable internet. By observing Rain’s marketing mix, we shall understand how Rain made the most of the lockdown. Firstly, we shall look at the company and discern the products they produce, then examine Rain’s strategic pricing methods, placement and promotion. Afterwards, we shall examine process, physical evidence and people, as Rain is a service company.</p><p>Product</p><p>As Rain is a telecommunications company, they are predominantly a services company as they provide the service of being able to access the internet. Although, they do offer products in the form of sim cards and routers, however these products could simply be viewed as access tokens to the service and are generally provided free of charge with the purchase of a month-to-month contract. Their core benefit is giving consumers access to the Internet of Things and ability to connect to those around them. Their actual service product is quality internet connection through the purchase of data bundles or end of month payments for data. This data is often unlimited and is successfully maintained through the various infrastructure positioned around South Africa. As they are a data-only company, this results in the added advantage of Rain gained brand recognition in 2019, when it was the first telecommunications company to launch a standalone 5G network in Africa (Huawei, 2020). This allowed Rain to differentiate themselves from the other strong competitors namely Vodacom and MTN. They also focus on their strategic pricing methods.</p><p>As COVID-19 resulted in many people working from home, it resulted in a greater demand for telecommunications, therefore Rain had a beneficial product that flourished due to the pandemic noting a 20% to 70% increase in data-based calls (Ericsson, 2020). There was also an increase in subscribers for 5G with an increase from under 20 000 subscribers to under 80 000 subscribers per month (Muller, 2020). Therefore, Rain has strongly benefited from the pandemic.</p><p>Pricing</p><p>As the telecommunications industry is lightly regulated, it has given rise to a monopoly of Telkom, MTN and Vodacom, which has resulted in a fairly high pricing structure (South African Foundation, 2005). Rain has strategically low prices, which undermines their competitors’ prices and appeals to a larger market. Rain effectively makes use of psychological pricing to make their prices appear cheaper – pricing bundles at R999, R699 and R379. This strategy makes the final digit odd in order to make prices appear cheaper, which plays to the company’s strengths, as they are appealing to (Holdershaw et al., 1997). Rain also effectively makes use of promotional allowance pricing, as they reward their consumers who purchase their initial Rain 5G for home bundle, as they give them a free router with the purchase (Rain, 2020). This makes Rain more appealing, as the router is necessary to access the internet, thus promoting their 5G product.
Rain’s pricing strategy has been affective during the pandemic, as many people have suffered job loss and reduction in income, therefore through lower prices Rain is able to appeal to the large majority.</p><p>Place</p><p>One can purchase a Rain SIM card from participating Clicks stores, Mr Delivery, Takealot and online. This makes for easy access and a wide distribution. However, Rain does not provide network coverage for the whole of South Africa. They are predominantly based in larger cities and towns, such as Cape Town, Johannesburg and Pretoria. Rin partnered with Vodacom to rapidly install an LTE-A network, which assisted Rain with the challenging infrastructure growth and was beneficial for Vodacom’s capacity constraints (Mybroadband, 2019). However, this partnership has caused waves in the telecommunications industry and Telkom is challenging this arrangement (Mcleod, 2020).</p><p>Promotion</p><p>In order to effectively promote to consumers, Rain needs to understand their consumers. Rain believes data costs too much and that it should be a human right therefore, promoting data at R50 per gig with no contract, no bundles and no data expiry (Iles, 2019). This appeals to a large portion of the market that may not be able to afford other pricier data bundles. This is effective in poorer communities as the premise of data expiring is unappealing, as people would prefer to keep what they have purchased. Rain’s moral objective appeals to communities and thus creates a unique connection with the consumer. Rain’s main source of promotion is done through advertising online; however it also holds various competitions.</p><p>Process</p><p>Rain provides effective service delivery through ensuring fast, reliable internet connection. Rain’s 4G offers speed of 25 – 40 Mbps and 5G offers 200 – 700 Mbps and a low latency of 20-30 milliseconds for 4G and under 10 milliseconds for 5G (Rain, n.d.). In order to begin this process, a consumer needs to purchase a Rain SIM card from one of the various channels mentioned above. The consumer then has access to data and can track their data consumption daily online. They are also able to cancel their subscription at any point. This is useful for the pandemic as one can strictly manage data consumption if they are experiencing tight financial pressures. These processes are then maintained through online services and infrastructure maintenance.</p><p>Physical evidence</p><p>There is not a large amount of physical evidence as Rain operates mainly online, however they do have offices in Johannesburg, which portray a sense of professionalism. There are also a large number of network towers, that are discreetly place all around South Africa.</p><p>People</p><p>Rain varies slightly to other service industries as employees do not interact as closely with consumers, as they do in other service industries. However, due to COVID-19, this has been more beneficial for them, as they are able to maintain their business operations whilst social distancing. Rain consumers generally interact with employees through their website, where consumers have a personal account and can interact with the company and purchases. Rain also has a phone line where consumers can query the company and Rain can offer support.</p><p>In conclusion, Rain has provided a very useful service over the lockdown period. It has maintained the balance between efficiency and cost effectiveness and opened a service to consumers, who would otherwise not have had the finances to operate online. The have maintained COVID-19 social distancing regulations, through their online presence and online process operations. Rain has come out of the pandemic stronger and will continue to grow as the world shifts towards the fourth industrial revolution. This company has been part of the growth that helps ensure that all South African’s can grow with the changes, not simply the ones that can purchase expensive data bundles.</p><p>References</p><p>Ericsson. 2020.
